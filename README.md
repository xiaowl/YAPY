## Chinese-yapy
Yet Another PinYin input method implementation, which aims to provide:

- Fast
- Stable
- Low memory footprint


## Background
There is a very handy input method named Chinese-pyim, with the extra chinese-pyim-greatdict dictionary, it works very well on my MacBook Pro(late 2013). But recently I sometimes need to work on a virtual box which runs Lubuntu 16.04 with only 1G memory... Boom!
